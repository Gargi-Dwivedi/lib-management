Task 2: RESTful API Development for Virtual Library System

The second task focused on backend development, where I was assigned to build a fully functional RESTful API for a virtual library system using Python and the Flask framework. The goal was to implement a clean and modular API capable of handling standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through structured endpoints. I designed entities such as Book and Author, and established their relationships to mimic a real-world library database. Each endpoint was developed with appropriate HTTP methods, handling data in JSON format and including error responses for invalid inputs or actions. To ensure correctness and functionality, the API was rigorously tested using Postman, validating all routes and responses. The modular structure allowed for easy scalability and potential integration with a persistent database like SQLite or PostgreSQL. This task helped me gain practical experience in designing server-side logic, managing routes, handling client-server communication, and applying core backend principles in a real-world scenario.
